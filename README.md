# Edgey-Spoofer-Cracked
Nothing special, just standard paste

Their files get downloaded and stored in C:\Windows\apppatch\system KEKW
note: these aren't all the files, there is 1 clean files missing and also the driver + exe for asus motherboards, which will just be amidedos instead of amidewin im pretty sure

The password for the 4u4play (driverless.exe), is 4u4play. (LMAO)
Volumeid.exe = Volume Id Spoof (Windows tool)
amifldrv64.sys = Motherboard Driver (Amidewin)
edgey.exe = Motherboard Exe (Amidewin)
driverless.exe = 4u4play spoofer (temp)
user.exe = btbd cleaner
Volumeid64.exe = this one is interesting, I wouldn't run it because it might be a rat. it is signed with roblox cert and downloads roblox in a temp folder, yet it is named volumeid64 and is downloaded everytime once spoofing (I'm pretty sure it's some sort of rat/malware etc.)
